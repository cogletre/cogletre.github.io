	<!--
	Yapmo - Weather App
	
	This is my weather web application.
	
	Things I learned:
	1. JSON with web applications
	2. Utilizing WeatherSource.com API
	3. pages.github.io
	4. Callbacks in JavaScript
	5. Cross-Browser calls within JSONP
	
	Obvious flaws:
	1. The program times out very quickly as the number of dates included in the calculated average increases; not entirely sure right now how I would compensate for that, but it's definitely food for thought.
	2. Included no documentation in the actual code itself.
	3. Included no testing for inputs, such as errors for incorrect user input or testing date values to make sure of a feasible range.
